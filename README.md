Decision tree on - IRIS dataset

- **Summary of IRIS Dataset**

The IRIS dataset is a well-known and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset was first introduced by British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.

The IRIS dataset comprises four features, also known as attributes or variables, that are measured from each iris flower:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepals (the green leaf-like structures) in centimeters.
Sepal Width: The width of the sepals in centimeters.
Petal Length: The length of the petals (the colored part of the flower) in centimeters.
Petal Width: The width of the petals in centimeters.
Each sample is labeled with the species of the iris flower it belongs to. The goal of using the IRIS dataset is often to build and train machine learning models to classify new iris samples based on their features into one of the three species.


- **Summary of Decision Tree on IRIS Dataset**

The decision tree algorithm was applied to the well-known IRIS dataset, which contains samples of iris flowers belonging to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal of the decision tree model is to classify the flowers into their respective species based on the given features.

The decision tree effectively divided the dataset into regions based on specific features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By making binary splits at each node, the decision tree created decision boundaries in the feature space that separate the samples of different species.

The tree's hierarchical structure allowed for easy interpretability, providing a clear path from the root node to the leaf nodes representing the final predictions. The model could distinguish between the iris species by evaluating different feature thresholds at each internal node, resulting in accurate predictions for the test data.

The decision tree's ability to handle both numerical and categorical data made it suitable for this multi-class classification task. It demonstrated good performance, achieving high accuracy on the test dataset. The simplicity and interpretability of the decision tree made it easy to understand the decision-making process and the criteria used for classifying the iris flowers.

In conclusion, the decision tree model successfully classified the iris flowers into their respective species with high accuracy. Its interpretability and effectiveness make it a valuable tool for various classification tasks, especially when the goal is to understand the underlying decision-making process and obtain meaningful insights from the data.
